				<p>This is a list of Continental dishes. </p>
                                <p>  When used by Westerners, the term may sometimes refer more specifically to cuisine in Europe; in this context, a synonym is Continental cuisine, especially in British English.</p>
<p>The cuisines of Western countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that 

distinguish Western cooking from cuisines of Asian countries and others. </p><p>
Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, 
meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size. Steak and cutlet in particular are common dishes across the West.
Western cuisines also put substantial emphasis on grape wine and on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in Western cooking). Many dairy products are utilised in the cooking process, except in nouvelle cuisine.
Wheat-flour bread has long been the most common source of starch in this cuisine, along with pasta, dumplings and pastries, although the potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonisation of the Americas.</p>
